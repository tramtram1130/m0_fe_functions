# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

I am doing my best not to procrastinate, but ultimately end up cramming everything when I should get up and take
a short break every hour or so. I can fix this by setting an hourly timer to remind myself to get up and the
blood circulating.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

Imagine if you have to type a fill-in-the-blank over and over with new information each time.
A function automates it by only asking you what needs to be in the blank and it'll finish
up the rest and plug in what you gave it.

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.

When you first define a function, you can set up parameters by putting it between a set of parenthesis.
Parameters are empty variables that needs a connecting data type and it gains it by setting up arguments
when calling the function. Setting arguments up is similar to how parameters are set up and it must be in
a respective order if there's more than one parameter.


- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?

I'd want to ask them if they feel defeat from their code breaking when ran the first time  
and it ends up taking additional tweaking before it runs properly. It's a lot of strict
and specific syntax to absorb.
